# Group-Project
To download the application, clone the repository into a folder on your desktop. 
After the cloning process is done, move through the command line into the new folder that has been created into the old one and contains all of the application files.
Compile the application using the command "javac BusyB.java".
When compilation is done, it's time to run the application.
When the application runs for the first time, the proper command is "java BusyB 1". When the value of args equals to 1, the app deletes all of the previously existing data and it allows the user to insert new ones.
On daily basis, the proper command to run the application is "java BusyB 0".
A pom.xml file is available, but is currently under construction.
